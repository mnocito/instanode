# instanode
Instagram copy-cat website written with node.js.

Features include user profiles, posting, tagging, following, liking, commenting, hashtagging (and pages to view posts with a certain hashtag), and realtime alerts on new likes/comments. 

The frontend is angularjs, and the backend is nodejs + express. The database I'm using is mongodb.
